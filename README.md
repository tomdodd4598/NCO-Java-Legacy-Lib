NCO Legacy Lib
==============


Summary
-------

A simple library mod which contains classes needed by NCO addons such as [QMD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qmd), [Trinity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinity) and [NuclearCraft Steam Additions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nc-steam-additions) since NCO's most recent updates.

Almost all code in this library is modified from NCO version 2o.6.2.


Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any Minecraft mod I make means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code, excluding any bundled APIs from other mods (which are covered by the respective licenses in their packages), is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/NCO-Java-Legacy-Lib/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
